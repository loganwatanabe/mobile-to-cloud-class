			<h3>67-250 The Information Systems Milieux</h3>
			<h5>Fall: 9 units</h5>
			Information systems (IS) are changing work practices, reshaping organizations, transforming cultures, and giving new meaning to the ways we see the world. This course is designed to help students understand the role of IS in modern society and the means by which these systems are created. It provides not only a framework for understanding information and information systems, but also a language to identify their dynamic complexities and interdependencies. Topics include: current trends in IS, structured approaches to the creation of IS, corporate IS competitive advantage, business process improvements/reengineering, eCommerce and the digital economy, knowledge management, decisions support systems, and the implications of IS for people, organizations and society. Classes will use a combination of lectures, class discussions, reading assignments, case studies, group projects, and “hands-on” work in database design. This course is a required professional core course for sophomores in the IS major. Non-IS sophomores may enroll by special permission.
